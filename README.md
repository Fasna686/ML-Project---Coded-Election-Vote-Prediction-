# ML-Project---Coded-Election-Vote-Prediction-
Machine Learning

**ML Project - Coded (Election Vote Prediction)**  
*Course: Machine Learning - 2*  
*Date: February 2024*

**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on predicting the political party a citizen is likely to vote for based on their demographic information and responses to a survey. The survey dataset includes variables such as age, economic conditions, and political knowledge, which serve as inputs for the predictive modeling.

**Objectives:**
1. **Predictive Modeling:** Develop machine learning models to forecast voters' party preferences.
2. **Performance Evaluation:** Assess the accuracy and effectiveness of different models using various performance metrics.
3. **Descriptive Analysis:** Analyze election candidates' speeches to provide additional insights into the electoral context.

**Methodologies:**
- **Machine Learning Techniques:**
  - **Naive Bayes:** Used to classify voter preferences based on probabilistic inference.
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Implemented to predict voting choices based on the similarity of feature vectors.
  - **Ensemble Methods:** Applied to combine predictions from multiple models, improving overall accuracy and robustness.

- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on both training and test datasets.

- **Text Mining:** Analyzed speeches from election candidates to extract relevant themes and sentiments, enriching the understanding of voter behavior.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted comprehensive data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the survey data, facilitating informed model building and interpretation.

**Skills & Tools Covered:**
- **Naive Bayes Classification**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Ensemble Techniques**
- **Text Mining**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

This project provided valuable insights into voter behavior and demonstrated the application of various machine learning techniques to real-world electoral data.
